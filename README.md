# qwac_handler
QWAC Handler - An Experimental WebExtension to detect, validate, and display 1-QWACs (per ETSI 119 411-5).

**This is NOT production-grade software!**

I developed this WebExtension in (some of) my spare time, __just for fun__.

This software is NOT bug-free; is NOT supported; is NOT optimized. I did NOT worry about privacy. I did NOT follow any software engineering methodology. This software may cause your browser to become unresponsive or to crash.
Use this software AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Warning: this WebExtension only works with Firefox because I could not find a _reasonable_ way to obtain the web server's TLS certificate from Chrome or Safari. If you know one (that I have not yet considered), let me know.
